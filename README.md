### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

Write a piece, test, pray, continue...

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

I learned how to style lists better. I learned how to use media queries with a breakpoint in practice not just in theory-land.

### Continued development

I couldn't style the `1` in the `ol` to be sans serif with the provided font. I have to fix that when I feel like spending two hours on google. I want to better organize my CSS code because now it is just lightly following the page structure.
